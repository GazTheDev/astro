## Welcome to my new website!

I'd like to welcome you to my brand new website, it's still the same URl but as you can see it's a huge overhaul. I'm not going to get into the technical aspects of the site on this post, but will do in the future. I am very proud of the build and have made use of some new tech I wasn't expecting to use but am happy I did!. 

I am also now looking for work. Does your business need a website?. Give me a shout for an affordable quote.


I will also be posting some project work I am currently involved with some dev blogs.


Until next

Gareth
